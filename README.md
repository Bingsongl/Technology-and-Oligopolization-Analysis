# Technology and Oligopolization

Welcome to my class project for Cornell's INFO/COMM 4360 Networks and Social Capital

This repository contains the files to replicate the figures used in my class paper analysis. The research question is: "Are international arms trade for more technologically advanced arms more oligopolized by a few countries?"

All data here is publicly available at the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute [SIPRI](https://www.sipri.org/databases/milex)


## Key files
- The `data` folder contains the files downloaded from [SIPRI](https://www.sipri.org/databases/milex) and subsequently used in the analysis.

Each **.ipynb** file does not need to be run in a particular order
- [`simulation_plots.ipynb`](simulation_plots.ipynb) plots some simulated data to illustrate different hypotheses in the paper.
- [`2.1.weighted_analysis_by_tiv.ipynb`](2.1.weighted_analysis_by_tiv.ipynb) examines the distribution of the weighted degree distribution of the networks.
- [`2.2.all_category_analysis.ipynb`](2.2.all_category_analysis.ipynb) contains the main plots used in the paper showing how all arms categories fit a power law and conducting further analysis on the structural power held by oligopolists.
